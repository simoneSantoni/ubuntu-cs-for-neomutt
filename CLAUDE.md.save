This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a NeoMutt color scheme inspired by the Ubuntu Yaru color palette. NeoMutt is a command-line email client.

## NeoMutt Color Scheme Development

NeoMutt color schemes are typically defined in configuration files using the `color` command syntax:
```
color <object> <foreground> <background> [<pattern>]
```

Common objects to style include: `index`, `header`, `body`, `status`, `indicator`, `tree`, `quoted`, `attachment`, `sidebar`, and more.

To test a color scheme, source it in your neomuttrc:
```
source /path/to/colorscheme
```

Or run neomutt with:
```
neomutt -F /path/to/neomuttrc-with-colors
```
